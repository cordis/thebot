Welcome to TheBot's documentation!
==================================

TheBot is a general purpose chat bot, extensible in varios ways.
The reason, why it was written is because NodeJS and CoffeeScript are sucks and
Hubot uses them.

The Bot is written in orthodox Python and can be installed via [pip][].
It's functionality can be extended by installation of additional python packages,
you don't have to clone a repository and hack some code there.
