The Bot
=======

This is a general purpose chat bot, extensible in varios ways.
The reason, why it was written is because NodeJS and CoffeeScript are sucks and
Hubot uses them.

The Bot is written in orthodox Python and can be installed via [pip][].
It's functionality can be extended by installation of additional python packages,
you don't have to clone a repository and hack some code there.

Alternatives
------------

There are some bots written in Python, but all of them sucks, because,
most of the works only with IRC and none of them has such beautiful
architecture as The Bot.

But if you still have some doubts, here is a list of some bots. Go, try
them and come back to ask The Bot to forgive you treason.
